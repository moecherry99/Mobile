# Mobile Applications 3 in 1 Project - By Alex Cherry, G00347106

This project has been transferred from another repository as there has been some major changes.

The project is a 3 in 1 game app, where the user can pick which game they would like to go to and 
play!

The first page allows you to input your name and age and if the age is below 18 you will not be allowed to play. It also has 3 buttons to go to which game you would like to play.

The first game in the application is a click counter. The user will have two buttons, one to click "Ready" and the next to starting clicking labeled "Click fast!". Once the "Ready" button is clicked, the user will have to click the "Click fast!" button as fast as they can for 10 seconds. The button will become unclickable after 10 seconds, and text will appear and tell the user the amount of clicks they did in 10 seconds. (If project development goes well, session storage will be added to this and the users current record will be displayed and if they get a better record if they repeat the process, the record number will change accordingly.)
