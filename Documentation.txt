2nd April 10:20pm - Transferred project from other repository as new pages caused issues with old repository.

3rd April 20:30pm - Project Brief has been updated and new ideas for the project are going to be implemented. 

5th April 23:22pm - Updated main page with 3 buttons that navigate to other game pages. Also adjusted UI so 
that it relates to the project.

6th April 23:02pm - Updated 1st game page to allow for a click counter. Tracks amount of clicks that have been 
clicked. Working on getting 10 second timer to activate as first button is clicked.

7th April 13:17pm - Allowed for some "error" handling. All of game 1's starter text is now set back to default 
if the "Start Game 1" button is pressed. This means the counter does not hit over 20 at any given time.

8th April 12:54pm - Updated full Readme.MD to show all of the games in the application.
